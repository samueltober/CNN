# Convolutional Neural Network to Predict Country Based on Surnames
This project was aimed at building, training and optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch using Python with Numpy. The aim for my CNN was to predict the country of origin for a given family name, i.e. a multi-class classification problem.

All data can be found in the Data folder, and the code is collected in one .py file: ConvNet.py.
